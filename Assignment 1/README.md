# WebGL Experiments -- Globe

### https://www.newnaw.com/pub/js/webglglobe/worldelevation/

I liked this largely due to the underlying WebGL globe this site uses. It seems incredibly easy to use, and looks phenomenal (closer to graphics from Hackers (1995) = better). It's also a pretty good example of how powerful WebGL is, because this definitely would pass as modern as part of a desktop application. Lastly, I love this dataset in particular, because using data visualization tools seems like an unnecesary middleman to show the elevation of the planet (something that is not really abstract when looking at a globe).
